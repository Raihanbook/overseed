# Database management information

Please see the document "#24 - Installation Instructions.docx" for a more complete overview
of how to install the databases.

Overseed API uses the Flask SQLAlchemy package to simplify the interface with any underlying database.

By default, when running locally, the API uses a local SQLite database file. The SQLite interface is
installed through using the installation scripts provided with the application.

The Flask-SQLAlchemy version is 2.4.4
The SQL-Alchemy version is 1.3.23

NOTE: when operating locally, the data is stored in an SQLite database. On Heroku, this
is stored in a Postgres database. However, this is transparent to the end user as the
Flask ORM abstracts this difference.
