# Release notes for Overseed Application

# Caveats

- All test data is very similar (we will work on providing more variety for full submission), this can mean plant reports don't show variety

Please note that the Heroku password has an additional symbol at the end

# Known Issues

- The application is currently only using a hard coded API key for authentication this could be improved in the next version
- Company deletion doesn't clear out our device setup properly. 
- Heroku does not support static image uploads (as the file system is transient), this means uploaded images (for companies etc) may disappear the next time the server restarts (daily)
- Back button will not always work in some pages
